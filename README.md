# Airline_Customer_Satisfaction_Analysis
#### Data:
The goal of this project was to use passenger flight data to identify drivers that influence
airline customer satisfaction levels to improve overall customer satisfaction. The entire
dataset consisted of around 129889 airline customer survey responses (rows) over a span of
3 months and included data from 14 airlines. There were 28 columns in the dataset,
consisting of information collected from surveys requested by its airline customers. The data
analysis was performed using the programming language R for this project.

### Data Preprocessing and Analysis:
To visually explain the skewness and the value counts of the variables, we used histograms
and bar graphs. By removing inconsistencies in the Satisfaction section, assigning relevant
values in place of null values in some columns, we have done some data transformation. Our
final step in mingling data was to establish "High" and "Low" binary satisfaction categories to
assist in our future research to differentiate between these two classes.

### Data Analysis:
To evaluate variables that have a significant effect on customer satisfaction, we used
machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Association
Rules mining.

### Objectives Accomplished:
We used various methods, such as substituting mean and median for the missing values and
carefully eliminating the outliers as discussed in the course. In order to define the effect of
different attributes on the target, we used linear regression. We also used mining association
rules to discover relationships with different demographic attributes with the customer
satisfaction goal attribute, which helped us make appropriate suggestions and provide actionable
insights. We have used different visualizations such as bar charts, boxplots, and maps to help our
analytics customers look at the visual representation of the data (program outcome 3). To further
evaluate and forecast factors influencing customer satisfaction, we were effective in transforming
the data according to our requirements, recognizing and analyzing each variable and using
machine learning principles. We summarized the key actionable insights (program outcome 4 and
5). The actionable findings from our research were also discussed. Overall, through this initiative,
we illustrated all the main learning goals.
